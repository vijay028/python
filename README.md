Python projects: 
This repository has all my work done on Python. It varies from scritps to web apps.
I am a learner and Python enthusiast experimenting and solving problems in Python/Flask/Django framework.

Disclaimer: In some cases I've used somebody else's lines of code just to solve the problem at hand. 
            In some cases, those lines have inspired me to do more on that front. 
            I believe, all those codes are shared for each other's learning. 
            I thought, I just mention that and remain true to myself :)

You are most welcome to give feedback on anything you think is important for me to pay attention to. Thanks in Advance.

Pull requests are most welcome. Actually, it's great to collaborate.

Thank you

Vijay Kulkarni
